# Ḵutí Project - Collaborative Hazard Mitigation in Southeast Alaska

## Overview  
The Ḵutí project, named after the Tlingit word for weather, is a five-year NSF-funded research initiative aimed at developing tools to mitigate risks associated with precipitation-induced hazards such as landslides and floods in Southeast Alaska. The project involves a multidisciplinary team comprising atmospheric scientists, geoscientists, hydrologists, social scientists, and crucially, community leaders and Tribal environmental staff.  

## Objectives  
The overarching goal of the Ḵutí Project is to collaboratively work with six communities in Southeast Alaska—Skagway, Hoonah, Klukwan, Yakutat, Craig, and Kasaan—to create tools that reduce the impact of precipitation-induced hazards. By engaging with a diverse range of experts and community representatives, the project aims to enhance resilience and preparedness in the face of weather-related challenges.
